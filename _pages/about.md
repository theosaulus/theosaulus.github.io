PhD student at Mila (Quebec AI Institute) and Université de Montréal.

My research focuses on understanding how models can robustly generalize and develop meaningful abstractions, with an emphasis on causality and applications to scientific discoveries.

Previously, I graduated from CentraleSupélec and École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay and completed research internships at Stanford University and InstaDeep.
